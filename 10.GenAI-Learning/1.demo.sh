Generative AI - Tokens, Chunking, embeddings etc..

GenAI is transforming industries - It powers applications such as text generation, image creation etc...

It is a Pre-trained Language Model.

GenAI generates new content based on pre-trained modela...
IT does prettymuch everything... text,images,audio,vedio and even code etc..

genAI comprises of
  1. Models
  2. Transformers
  3. Prompt Engineering
  4. Inference
  5. Context Window
  6. Token
  7. Vector
  8. Embeddings
  9. Chunking
  10. Multi-Mode Models
  11. Diffusion Models
