Vector Databases store data as embeddings, which are numerical representations of data like text and images.

These embeddings allow fast, efficient and semantically relevant searches for AI and machine learning tasks.

Several AWS Services help store and manage embeddings in vector databases.


Amazon OpenSearch service for Generative AI.
k-Nearest Neighbors(k-NN) for the efficient queries.


Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition and Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL support pgvector
1. pgvector extension available on Amazon Aurora and Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL.
2. Enables storage and similarity searches using ML-generated embeddings
3. Embeddings capture semantic meaning from text processed by large language models(LLMs)

Amazon Neptune ML:
-------------------------->
Uses Graph Neural Networks(GNNs) to enhance predictions using complex graph relationships.

Vector Search for amazon memoryDB

Vector search by Amazon DocumentDB(with MongoDB compatibility)

RAG with Amazon Bedrock and Custom Knowledge bases.

RAG combines retrieved data with generative models.
Amazon Bedrock supports RAG by integrating with custom knowledge bases.
