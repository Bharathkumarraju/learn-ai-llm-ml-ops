Amazon Bedrock uses RAGs to enhance foundational model performance in customer applications.

Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Kendra USe Vector database to enhance foundation model performance in semantic search and document retrieval.


Selecting the Pre-trained Models:

RAG(Retrieval Augmented Generation) is a method that basically combines two components i.e.
Large language model generation and information Retrieval.


Basically it take Large Language model and it retrieves information.

So the goal of RAG is to basically retrieve that information and ingested into the model.
