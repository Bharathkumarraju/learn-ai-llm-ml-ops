RLHF: Reinforcement Learning by Human Feedback



LLMOps:
------------------------------------------------------------------------>

1. Scalabillity:  Managing computational resources to handle varying workloads without promising performance.
2. Latency Optimization: Reducing response times for real-time application through model optimization and efficient infrastructure
3. Monitoring and Logging: Continuously Tracking model outputs for quality assurance and compliance, enabling rapid response to issues.
4. Version Control and Updates: Maintaining consistent performance across model updates, with rollback mechanisms in case of unforseen problems
