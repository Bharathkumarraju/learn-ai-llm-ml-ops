Imperative programing  to declarative programing

Paradigm Shift  --->
01. Supervised Learning  (like school with children - you need to show multiple examples of cat and dog and allow them to learn)

02. Unsupervised Learning ( its like throwing a baby in an unknown environment asking to figure it out on his own - we didnt give examples )

03. Reinforcement Learning ( train the system - feedback loop )

04. Self-Supervised Learning -- reward or penalise by itself.


Natural Language Processing - NLP built on Neural Networks

Idea of GPUs, CUDA  and crawling of common datasets ... i.e crwaling of large-datasets leads to new era of tech called --- Artificail Intelligence(AI)


Transformers in AI... is moslty matrix operations

LLMs - transformers are the key

Gemini
Llama
GPT - Generative Pre-trained Transformer
