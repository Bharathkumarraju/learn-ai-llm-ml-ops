Imperative programing  to declarative programing

Paradigm Shift  --->
01. Supervised Learning  (like school with children - you need to show multiple examples of cat and dog and allow them to learn)

02. Unsupervised Learning ( its like throwing a baby in an unknown environment asking to figure it out on his own - we didnt give examples )

03. Reinforcement Learning ( train the system - feedback loop )
