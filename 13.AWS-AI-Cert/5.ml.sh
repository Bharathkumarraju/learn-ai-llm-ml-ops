Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs):
PDPs help illustrate the relationship between input variables and the models output, making the models behavior easier to understand and explain to stakeholders.


A company is developing a call center application and wants to extract insights from customer conversations. Which solution best meets this requirement?
Amazon Transcribe is ideal for converting speech to text, enabling further analysis and extraction of key information from customer calls.


A company wants to generate synthetic data based on its existing data. Which type of model is best suited for this task?
GANs are specifically designed to generate realistic synthetic data by learning the distribution of the input data.

Q: A company uses Amazon SageMaker for its ML pipeline in production.
   The company handles input data sizes of up to 1 GB and processing times of up to 1 hour, but needs near real-time latency.
   Which SageMaker inference option meets these requirements?
A: SageMakers asynchronous inference is designed for large data loads and longer processing times while still delivering low-latency results without needing a persistent connection.



Import data into Amazon SageMaker Canvas and build ML models by selecting values from the Canvas data..
Amazon SageMaker Canvas is designed for users with limited coding skills, enabling them to build ML models and forecasts by selecting values from the data directly.



Reduce the number of tokens in the prompt.. Reducing the token count in the prompt can lower processing costs without affecting performance, especially when the model is invoked infrequently.


Deploy the custom model on an Amazon SageMaker endpoint for real-time inference.

Q: A law firm wants to develop an AI application using large language models (LLMs) that can read legal documents and extract their key points. Which solution meets these requirements?
A: Develop a summarization chatbot.. A summarization chatbot based on an LLM can be trained to read and condense legal documents, extracting only the most critical information.


GenAI models -- Creating photorealistic images from text descriptions for digital marketing..
Generative AI models are often used to generate creative content, such as photorealistic images based on textual input, which is particularly useful in digital marketing.


Guardrails for Amazon Bedrock help ensure that generative models produce content that is appropriate and aligned with safety and ethical guidelines, making it ideal for childrens applications.

Model parameter count is a technical metric that measures the size and complexity of a model, not a business metric focused on financial or customer impact.

Prompt modeling involves designing templates that can be reused with different inputs, streamlining the process of prompt engineering.




a) Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor, b) Amazon A2I (Amazon Augmented AI). Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor tracks deployed models for issues like data drift,
  while Amazon A2I allows for the easy integration of human review for low-confidence predictions or periodic audits.

a) Decision Trees.. Decision trees are interpretable models that clearly show how decisions are made at each node, making it easier to understand how gene characteristics influence classification.


AMazon Polly: is a text-to-specch service that uses advanced deep learning techniques to produce natural sounding speech.



Mask confidential data in the inference responses using dynamic data masking.. Dynamic masking of confidential data in the inference responses ensures that sensitive information is not revealed without the need to retrhe model.


Amazon Comprehend and Amazon Bedrock
Amazon Comprehend can analyze textual sentiment, while Amazon Bedrock offers language models that can be fine-tuned to enhance sentiment analysis capabilities.



 To teach the model to follow specific instructions..
 Instruction fine-tuning involves training the model with input-output pairs that are formatted as instructions, helping it learn to respond appropriately to user commands.


AUC-ROC --- Area Under the Curve - Reciever Operator Curve

Context-window defines how much text the model can consider in one prompt, which is crucial for tasks that require processing long inputs.

An anomaly detection system is well-suited to identify unusual patterns, such as suspicious IP addresses, thereby helping to secure the application.


Amazon EC2 Trn-series. The EC2 Trn-series is designed to be energy-efficient and optimized for ML training, thereby minimizing environmental impact.


Pairs of customer messages with the correct customer intents.. Providing pairs of customer messages and their corresponding correct intents helps the model learn context and improve its intent detection accuracy in a few-shot setting.

Amazon SageMaker JumpStart provides pre-trained models and ready-to-use notebooks, enabling rapid deployment and testing within a VPC.
