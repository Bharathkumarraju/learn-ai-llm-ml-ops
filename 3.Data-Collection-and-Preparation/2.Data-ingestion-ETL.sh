Where data stored in an organization

  1. Customer Relationship Management(CRM) Systems - information about customers, interactions and sales opportunities
  2. Marketing automation platforms
  3. Social Media Platforms
  4. Mobile app and website analytical data
  5. Databases - Structured and unstructured data storage for analysis and reporting
  6. IoT devices data
  7. Google sheets, documents, images etc


Now how can we consolidate all of the above information and store it in one place.
So this process is called ETL - Extract, Transform and Load

Extract -- Gathering raw data from DBs, APIs, Flatfiles - tools there like talend, DBT etc
Transform -- cleaning, filtering and aggregating the data.
Load -- Loading data into a target system like Data warehouse, Data lake and Repository.


ETL is important i.e. to gather the required data for our modeling purpose.
