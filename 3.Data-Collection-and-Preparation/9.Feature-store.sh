A game-changing component in the MLops-Landscape is feature store.

Traditional systems like Data-Lakes pose challenges such as data latency, consistency, and reusability challenges for real-time ML applications.

A real-time application like flight-booking service use feature-store to address those challenges

a flight-booking application that uses real-time ML to recommend optimal ticket prices.

Without a feature store, the system may rely on a slow batch data lake process, leading to outdated price predictions.
With a feature store, real-time features such as:
   Current flight demand,
   Weather conditions,
   Seat availability,
   Competitor pricing and
   User search history  are precomputed, stored, and served instantly to the ML model, ensuring low-latency, accurate recommendations.
