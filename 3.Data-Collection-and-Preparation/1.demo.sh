Data collection and preperation

Collection relevant data to make informed decisions is the crux of any ML-Model.

The more accurate and comprehemsive the data is the better the prediction will be.

In Real-world scenarions the data is from different platforms
like Spread sheets, SQL Databases and NoSQL databases..It is essential to centralise the data first and cleant it first,
before using it in our ML models.

Data collection and preperation for model training.

how are we going collect the data and preprocess data before handing over to ML to train it.

what are the methods available to collect and process the data.

1. ETLs Data ingestions, Data lake, Feature store  and
2. Data Preperations using spark, pandas etc...

So before building ML models ... Data collection and Preperations plays vital role.
