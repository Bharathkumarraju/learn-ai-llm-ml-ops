As a cricket player, subjective opinions about players can vary greatly depending on personal preferences and criteria for "better." Both Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli are exceptional cricketers with impressive records for India.

- **Rohit Sharma** is known for his elegant batting style, ability to play big innings, and success as an opening batsman, especially in limited-overs cricket. He has several double centuries in ODIs and has been a key player in India’s success in white-ball cricket.

- **Virat Kohli** is renowned for his aggressive batting, consistency across all formats, and as one of the best chasers in ODIs. He has numerous centuries in all formats and has captained the Indian team, leading them to significant victories.

Ultimately, "better" can depend on what aspects of cricket one values more—classical stroke play versus aggressive run chasing, or limited-overs performance versus all-format excellence. Both players have made significant contributions to the Indian cricket team, and comparing them directly may not fully capture their individual strengths and roles in the team.
