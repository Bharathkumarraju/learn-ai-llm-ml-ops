1. Machine Learning(ML) & Artificial Intelligence(AI)
 ML - Learn from data without explicitly being programmed, identify what comes next in the data - i.e. pattern recognition
 AI - Performs complext tasks like only humans can do, such as reasoning, making decisions or solving problems ..ex: Generation, language understanding, code generation

2. LargeLanguage Models
  LLM- Its AI sysem trained in vast data-systems...
  LLMs take in a prompt input text, and use probabilities to predict the next word, or sequence of words. THis prediction is based-on patterns learned during training.

  2. RAG
  3. Fine-Tuning
  LLM Optimization - how the model needs to act
  Contect Optimization - what the model needs to know


3. Generative AI(GPT-4 & DALL-E)


4. Built on Neural Networks


5. Training Models
