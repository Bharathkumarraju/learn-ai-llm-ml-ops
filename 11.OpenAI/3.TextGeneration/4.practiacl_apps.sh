This is a recursive function in Python that calculates the factorial of a given number 'n'.

The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to that number. For example, the factorial of 5 (denoted as 5!) is 1*2*3*4*5 = 120.

Here's how the function works:

- If the input number 'n' is either 0 or 1, the function returns 1. This is because the factorial of 0 and 1 is 1.

- If 'n' is greater than 1, the function returns the product of 'n' and the factorial of 'n-1'. This is done by recursively calling the same function with the argument 'n-1'.

For example, if we call factorial(5), it will return 5 * factorial(4). The factorial(4) call will return 4 * factorial(3), and so on, until factorial(1) returns 1. Then, all the returned values are multiplied together to give the final result.
