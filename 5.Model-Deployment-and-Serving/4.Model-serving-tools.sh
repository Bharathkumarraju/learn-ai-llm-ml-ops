Powerful Model Serving, Model deployments Frameworks

1. TensorFlow serving
2. PyTorch (TorchServe)
3. BentoML


If we are working on tensorflow computer vision model that needs to process the thousands of image per second, Tensorflow serving is the goto choice.

For PyTorch NLP models requiring A/B testing capabilities, ofcourse TorchServe is a goto choice - We can easily integrate TorchServe with Amazon Sagemaker or kubernetes for automated deployments.

For teams needing Framework-agnostic solution with robust MLOps integration, BentoML fits perfectly.
