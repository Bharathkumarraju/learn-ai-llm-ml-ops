mlflow - Managing ML experiments


1. Model Selection - (Select from different machine learning models)
2. Run experiments on the selected models
3. Test the same-data with different ML Models

The important step is visualizing the data and trying to understand which model is the best fit for this usecase.
This is an iterative process - and this is where MLflow is actually helpful.
