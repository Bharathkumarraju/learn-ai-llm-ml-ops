Grid Search technique used for optimizing hyperparameters in the training process

below two metrics should be monitored to ensure that a model is balanced between precision and recall

Precision and recall assess how well the model balances capturing relevant instances and minimizing false positives.
True Positive Rate (Recall) and False Negative Rate (inversely related to precision) help monitor model performance.



After training a model, the precision is high, but recall is low. Which adjustment should be made to improve recall?
Lowering the threshold increases the number of true positives, thereby improving recall.
