Large Language Model:

1. Natural Language generation
2. Image Generation
3. Code Generation


Language Models:
-------------------------->
How AI been trained to make decisions like human is like this ---

AI uses transformer model. It has two parts, the Encoder and Decoder.

First we feed the model with large amount of data. This could be from book, scientific papers that helps the model to learn language patterns.

Then we feed this data to transformer model -

So the encoder will take these words and converts them into floating pointing numbers, which are known as embeddings.
Each word that means each embeddings gets mapped to as set of coordinates in a multi-dimensional space.

Now that the model has learned from all this data, It can start making predictions.

So when user give it a prompt,
Like ----  When my bird was  the decoder uses the embeddings and patterns it learned during the training  to generate a natural language sequence -
So in this case, it might suggest chirping as completion.
