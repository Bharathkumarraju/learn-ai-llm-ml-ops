Language training done in 3 steps

1. Tokenization
2. Embeddings
3. Attention

Tokenization breaks sentence down into numbers that the model can process.
Embeddings helps the model to understand the relationship between words by positioning them in a meaning based space.
Attention allows the model to focus on the most relevant words when making predictions
