Determining whether an email is spam or not,
Predicting a customers likelihood of repaying a loan,
Detecting fraudulent credit card transactions,
Identifying whether an image contains a cat or a dog

Classification models are used when the task involves categorizing data into predefined labels or classes.

Examples include identifying spam emails, assessing loan repayment likelihood classifying as likely or unlikely to repay,
detecting fraud (fraud or no fraud), and
distinguishing between different objects in images (cat or dog).

Clustering tasks (like grouping customers) and forecasting (predicting sales figures) are not classification tasks but rather clustering and regression, respectively.

Clustering models are generally evaluated based on metrics that assess the compactness and separability of clusters, such as the average distance to the cluster center.
Combined evaluation can include measures like intra-cluster distance and silhouette score.

RMSE, accuracy, precision, and coefficient of determination are more typical of regression and classification models.

 The "Explain best model" option aligns with Microsofts Responsible AI principles, particularly transparency.

 By providing explanations for the best-performing model, Azure Machine Learning allows users to understand how the model makes decisions,
 ensuring that AI systems are interpretable, trustworthy, and transparent.

 This is crucial for responsible AI deployment, helping users understand, debug, and trust the AIs outputs.

 Azure Machine Learning Studio offers various types of compute resources including
 Compute Instances for development,
 Compute Clusters for scalable training,
 Kubernetes Clusters for deployment, and
 Attached Compute for using external compute resources.

(Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE),
R-Squared (Coefficient of Determination),
Mean Absolute Error (MAE),
Mean Squared Error (MSE)):

For regression models, Azure ML typically evaluates performance using metrics like
RMSE,
MAE,
MSE, and
R-Squared.

These metrics help determine how closely the predicted values match the actual values.

Metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall are more appropriate for classification tasks rather than regression.

Utterances,
Intents,
Entities
For training language models, especially for natural language processing tasks like conversational AI,
key elements include
utterances (sample phrases that users might say),
intents (the purpose or goal behind an utterance), and
entities (specific information or variables extracted from the utterances).

These components help the model understand and process language inputs effectively.
Vocabulary and general text samples can also be useful depending on the task, but the listed components are essential for creating structured conversational models.

Detecting tumors on X-ray images,
Visual product search,
Face recognition,
Categorizing animal species from photos

Image classification is a technique that identifies the category to which an object in an image belongs

Examples include
detecting medical conditions (e.g., tumors in X-rays),
recognizing and searching products visually,
identifying faces, and
classifying images of animals.

Recognizing text in images typically falls under optical character recognition (OCR), while
entity recognition is a natural language processing (NLP) task related to text analysis, not image classification.

Personal Digital Assistants primarily rely on the Bot Framework,
which allows for natural language processing and interaction with users, integrating various services such as Speech and Text Analytics

 Semantic Segmentation is the process of classifying each pixel in an image to associate it with a particular object class.
 This allows for a more detailed understanding of the image, beyond simple object detection or classification.
